### Hi üëãüèº


I'm a Full Stack Developer at <a href="https://github.com/agencyenterprise">AE Studio</a>

<p>
I've been dealing with web development for +5 years through personal projects, freelancing, or work. My area of expertise is the JavaScript ecosystem where I've been using React, Node.js, and Typescript to build Web Applications. Despite enjoying working with this stack, at the end of the day, what I really like to do is to build things that are useful for others. Because of this, I already used different tools, languages, and I'm always open to trying new technologies.
</p>

<p>
My previous experiences go from quickly developing simple MVPs to maintaining complex products with multiple services.
</p>

<p>
I like to be humble, but I‚Äôm confident in my abilities to build digital products from idea to scaling in production. My current goal is to keep improving my skills, deal with relevant problems, share knowledge with other engineers and keep learning about best practices in software development.
